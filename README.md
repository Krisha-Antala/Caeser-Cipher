# Caesar Cipher

This project is a web-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique used to encode and decode messages. The application provides an interactive user interface for encoding and decoding text using a shift key and customizable settings.

## Features

- **Encode and Decode**: Easily switch between encoding and decoding operations.
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Shift Key: Define the number of positions to shift characters.
  - Modulo: Set the modulo value for the cipher.
  - Alphabet: Customize the alphabet used for encoding/decoding.
  - Letter Case: Choose to maintain, convert to lower case, or convert to upper case.
  - Foreign Characters: Decide whether to remove or ignore foreign characters.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Bootstrap for a clean and modern look.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the output text to the clipboard.
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications for user actions and feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the application.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the Caesar Cipher operations and interactive features.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and modern UI components.

## How to Use

1. **Select Operation**: Choose between "Encode" or "Decode".
2. **Set Parameters**:
   - Enter the shift key.
   - Define the modulo value.
   - Customize the alphabet if needed.
   - Select letter case and foreign character handling options.
3. **Input Text**: Enter the plaintext or ciphertext in the input area.
4. **Submit**: Click the "Submit" button to process the text.
5. **View Output**: The result will appear in the output area.
6. **Copy to Clipboard**: Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the output.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: Custom CSS file for additional styling.
- `caesar.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for the Caesar Cipher and interactive features.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krisha-Antala/Caeser-Cipher.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Caeser-Cipher
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the application.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional encryption techniques.
- Include error highlighting for invalid inputs.
- Enhance visual feedback with animations.
